# Gatsby Blog Project Progress


2019/02/19
* Find it difficult to ask questions about Gatsby JS. Could not find the right community for it.
* Keep switching between "start from ground up" and "continue making progress on existing project"
* Might have to find a temporary solution when it comes to the main page design.
    * Have not been able to move the blog section into index.js
    * Forgot to put any styling inside the index.js's `<Layout></Layout>` section
    * **remember to edit footer.js later**

* Finish the HTML/CSS part of the 404 page. https://codepen.io/zhouxiang19910319/pen/GzeePV, how to convert this into a randdom quote machine AND put it into my gatsby blog is another question.

* Had some progress when it comes to the gatsby blog. Learned the difference between using bootstrap VS react-bootstrap in gatsby site.

* Had some progress on re-doing the main page, eventually chose CSS in JS to do it.
* Finished index page's layout.

* W3 project had some progress too. Successfully get the weather data using open weather API + fetch method. 
* Next steps: 
  * Code the UI
  * Put in all the elements (icons + fonts + colors etc), find the right ones.
