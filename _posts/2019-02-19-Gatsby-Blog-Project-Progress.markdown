# Gatsby Blog Project Progress


* 2019/02/19
* Find it difficult to ask questions about Gatsby JS. Could not find the right community for it.
* Keep switching between "start from ground up" and "continue making progress on existing project"
* Might have to find a temporary solution when it comes to the main page design.
    * Have not been able to move the blog section into index.js
    * Forgot to put any styling inside the index.js's `<Layout></Layout>` section
    * **remember to edit footer.js later**
