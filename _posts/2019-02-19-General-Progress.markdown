# General Progress


2019/02/19
* Find it difficult to ask questions about Gatsby JS. Could not find the right community for it.
* Keep switching between "start from ground up" and "continue making progress on existing project"
* Might have to find a temporary solution when it comes to the main page design.
    * Have not been able to move the blog section into index.js
    * Forgot to put any styling inside the index.js's `<Layout></Layout>` section
    * **remember to edit footer.js later**

2019/02/20
* Finish the HTML/CSS part of the 404 page. https://codepen.io/zhouxiang19910319/pen/GzeePV, how to convert this into a randdom quote machine AND put it into my gatsby blog is another question.

* Had some progress when it comes to the gatsby blog. Learned the difference between using bootstrap VS react-bootstrap in gatsby site.

2019/02/21
* Had some progress on re-doing the main page, eventually chose CSS in JS to do it.
* Finished index page's layout.

* W3 project had some progress too. Successfully get the weather data using open weather API + fetch method. 
* Next steps: 
  * Code the UI
  * Put in all the elements (icons + fonts + colors etc), find the right ones.

2019/02/22 W3 Progress
* Steps: 
1. about swapping out all the icons: maybe use font awesome?

` 

2. **No need to differentiate day and night**
3. Use switch cases when it comes to the icon.
4. Code out the general UI?
5. Decided the main font of the project: Open Sans
6. Icon list:
    * Sun:  `<i class="far fa-sun"></i>`
    * Cloud: `<i class="fas fa-cloud"></i>`
    * Rain: `<i class="fas fa-cloud-showers-heavy"></i>`
    * Thunderstorm: `<i class="fas fa-bolt"></i>`
    * Snow: `<i class="fas fa-snowflake"></i>`
    * Mist: `<i class="fas fa-water"></i>`

7. Weather condition codes
    * 2xx: Thunderstorm
    * 3xx: Rain
    * 5xx: Rain
    * 6xx: Snow
    * 7xx: Mist
    * 800: Sun
    * 80x: Cloud

# **Side project idea.**
# **Google Chrome / Firefox / Safari bookmark syncing tool**

* Successfully made slowpacedcoding blog posts sorted by date. 

```
export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogIndexQuery{
      allMarkdownRemark
      (sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC })
      {
        edges{
          node{
            id
            frontmatter{
              path
              title
              date
              author
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
`
export default blogPage
```

* Changed some of the styling on blog post page.
* Tasks left to do: 
    1. Make the slowpacedcoding icon a responsive image using : `gatsby-image`. âœ…
    2. Find out why individual blog posts does NOT have any styling at all.
